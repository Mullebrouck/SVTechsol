                            <p class="engineering margin">In the semiconductor, pharmaceutical, disc drive and food processing markets, a cleanroom is used to prevent contamination, impurities or chemical substances, and decreasing yields in manufacturing. Product quality and yield are greatly affected by the ambient conditions of manufacturing. Clean rooms provide environments in which various kinds of air contaminants such as dust and microscopic organisms may be eliminated or minimized. Clean rooms have different degrees of cleanliness, ranging from <a class="text-links" href="quality.html">class zero to class 100,000</a>. Generally, cleanrooms rely on continuous filtration of the air for removal of any contaminant material which may be present or introduced.<br><br>S.V. Techsol designs, manufactures, and installs customized modular clean room systems suited for your manufacturing application and specifications. S.V. Techsol offers a complete service including, design, build, installation and testing of your clean room on site. S.V. Techsol can step you through the design process that will allow you to choose the best structure/materials, size, air flow and filters for your clean room requirements. S.V. Techsol specialized in custom clean rooms that utilize filter fan units that have low energy consumption and low sound levels.</p>
